As I've developed FIP I've realised there is a lack of documentation for Processing shaders. Below is a list of useful resources grouped by category.

## Learning about Processing shaders
- If you're writing shaders for Processing, I would highly recommend [this archived tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20210117181532/https://processing.org/tutorials/pshader/). 

- The replies to [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/processing/comments/ritpd8/shaders_in_processing/) list various resources and examples.

- [This Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38384768/processing-fragment-shader-not-displaying-anything) goes over some troubleshooting.

- What's the [difference between shader() and filter()](https://forum.processing.org/one/topic/filer-vs-shader.html )?

## Processing vs. p5.js shaders
- Processing uses "full OpenGL" but uses the specifications of OpenGL ES. 

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) uses WebGL which is a JavaScript API based on GL_ES. WebGL is specifically designed to work within web browsers and is a subset of the full OpenGL specification.
The GL_ES (OpenGL ES) variant is suitable for embedded systems, such as mobile devices, and is commonly used in web development.
